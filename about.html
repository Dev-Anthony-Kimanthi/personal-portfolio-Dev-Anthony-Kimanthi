    <h2>A brief introduction about myself, my background, skills, and passions.</h2>
    <!-- Students can add more personal details here -->
    <p>Hello, my name is Anthony Kimanthi. I am currently pursuing my education with a
       focus on becoming a software engineer, specializing in both web development and Android app development. 
       Along the way, I have been building skills in programming, including PHP, Python, and JavaScript, 
       while also exploring technologies like Kubernetes, machine learning, and IoT simulations. 
       Beyond academics, I enjoy working on side projects that challenge me to learn new tools 
       and concepts, such as experimenting with game development in Godot or setting up random web projects like a 
       quote generator. My passions lie in creating practical solutions with technology, 
       and my long-term career goal is to design and develop impactful applications that blend 
       innovation with real-world usefulness.</p>
